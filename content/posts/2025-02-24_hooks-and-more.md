Our group has been known to have a penchant for skyhook robberies - well maybe not so much these days but there's still a few people going for them. Last night there was a magma hook close to our chain so a few of us went out to see if we can rob it. During the actual robbery not much happened, an Arazu was on D-scan at some point but it disappeared quickly - either lurking or just left.

Once we finished the hook we decided to look around and one of our friends found an Anshar on a cyno beacon and tackled it. At first we thought it's bait but judging from local comms it was just someone making a not very sound decision while also not being in fleet. Since I was sitting in a Jaguar there wasn't much I could do apart from neuting a ship that had little use of cap and scramming it. Unfortunately our DPS was a bit slow to arrive and by the time they did the help arrived via the cyno beacon and started bubbling everything. I managed to burn out of a bubble and was about to warp off when I got scrammed and as my ship was destroyed up another bubble appeared so it was Jita express time.

Most of our fleet managed to get out and was looking to take the fight but the Anshar's friends just left. With nobody left to fight but still looking for content they went forward as I was shuttling back from Jita and they found a system with a good few people so decided to try and bait them. A couple of guys jumped ahead onto the ESS grid in a system while the rest was waiting a few systems back or reshipping.

I arrived just in time in an Osprey Navy Issue (horrible choice as it turned out for several reasons) and we jumped into the system as one of our friends slid into the ESS. We were waiting on grid with the ESS gate since that's a very favorable place to take fights at if you arrive first. There was a lot of back and forth, they had a big fleet trying to drive us out of their turf, many many Brutix Navy Issues, a Golem, a Typhoon Fleet, logi, ewar, they had some time to round out the fleet anyway.

Our fleet was full of very good pilots and it showed, they did very well and managed to kill a lot of the enemy ships while also staying alive as it shows on the BR below. Unfortunately I didn't really contribute at all, I was struggling to figure out how I could fly the Nosprey against a fleet that could apply from a much longer range than myself, I ended up trying to defang whatever was on our tackle and then died at one point when I misjudged the distance and my velocity. One positive thing I can think of is I got to the point at least where I'm using all my modules and managing cap fairly okay so there is some tangible progress regarding my skills but it was a rough night for me that's for sure.

As I said before the Nosprey was a bad choice, mainly because of the limited range on the RLMLs but also my inexperience and not "feeling" the ship as I only flew it a couple of times. To be honest after last night I don't think I'll be experimenting much with it anytime soon but we'll see.

Altogether it was great content and had fun but reflecting on my mistakes and watching back the recording did leave me with regret.
