Ping on Discord, one of my fellow managers found an unpowered POS with some ships around it, including a Lachesis. We jumped on with a good few people from the alliance, few DPS, some haulers and of course some shuttles we can just switch out of.

We emptied the modules from the containers (~1.8bil) and I stole one of their Kryos with my alt to take a full load of minerals worth of ~300mil then we started thinking how to take their ships from the Ship Maintenance Array. While we were talking, one of them appeared in a Malediction and managed to online the stick (none of us had scrams and our bubble just expired) which reduced the time we had to 7 minutes.

We destroyed their SMA and looked in the wreck, there was all sorts of stuff in there: Ishtar, Vargur, Tempest, Porpoise and more but we didn't have much time so we decided if we can't get anything out by the 1 minute mark we'll just shoot the wreck and destroy its contents. At around 1:15 left, one of their Vargur landed on us so we locked up the wreck and erased it and bailed.

(Small addendum, the Kryos that was destroyed on our side was theirs I sat in and then changed my mind about so I shot it before stealing their second Kryos.)
