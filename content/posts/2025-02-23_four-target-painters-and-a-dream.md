Busy day yesterday! Shortly after the events I wrote about in my previous post there was a ping in the hole Discord that someone tackled a Paladin. Given my SP and hangar limitations I decided I'd jump in a Vigil to just zoom around the place and paint whatever is called for, providing some damage bonus to the guys who do the actual work.

When I landed on grid there were already a few people around the Paladin, took it down to armor (unsurprisingly) but he was repping like there was no tomorrow. Soon a few of the Paladin's friends showed up, they brought a Falcon, a Harbinger, Cyclone Fleet Issue, couple of Jaguars and some other - slightly weird - choices.

I don't fly ewar too often so my main goal was to not get hit - ideally even targeted (which I accomplished apart from a few yellowboxes I bounced out of and a rat that was on my ass the whole time). I managed to stay in a good enough range most of the time and tried my best to paint things as they were called only missing an Astero that was way too far from me when it landed and got completely erased by the time I warped in.

Altogether the fleet managed to pick ships off one-by-one fairly easily, only suffering one casualty. I'm not entirely sure how useful my being there was but it was certainly more useful than me landing on grid with my Bellicose and getting deleted instantly - I'd like to think I provided some good DPS increase and it made some kills faster than they would've been.

As a closing paragraph, just want to share the advice that I finally internalized and ended up using a lot in this fight: even though the minimum distance you can warp to a fleetmate on grid is 150km, you can still warp to 100km from them, meaning you'll only close 50km distance and stay out of range without having to use your prop and valuable time.
